Welcome to my IoT Data Monitoring Project! This project focuses on the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system using an ESP32 microcontroller to collect and transmit environmental data. The system incorporates DHT11 and DS18B20 sensors to monitor temperature and humidity data. The collected data is seamlessly transmitted to the InfluxDB Cloud for storage and analysis, facilitating real-time insights. Additionally, I've integrated the Arduino IoT Cloud to enable remote monitoring and control of the device. This project sets the foundation for future enhancements, such as incorporating advanced sensors and implementing machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis.
